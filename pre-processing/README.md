This folder contains the R file used to 1) clean and combine 990 and 990-EZ datasets from each year (2013 to 2020), 2) clean and combine all historical EO-BMF datasets, including de-duplication, and 3) merge these 990 datasets with EO-BMF data, bringing together organization-year level data containing Employer Identification numbers with organization-year level data containing addresses.
